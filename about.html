<div id="record">
<h2>Record</h2>
<h3>Responsive Leadership</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maria Carrasco successfully sponsored the motion to allow an open microphone at School Committee meetings for parents and students to voice their concerns. This increased parents' involvement in their children's education. The <i>Daily Item</i> editorial board wrote, "We applaud freshman School Committee member Maria Carrasco for bringing this issue up" (October 2, 2008).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Taking on Tough Issues</h3>
<p>Maria has been a leader in stopping gang violence in our community. </p>
<ul>
<li>Responding to a threat of gang violence at a Lynn school, Maria immediately connected the principal and the Lynn Police Department to set up an anti-violence workshop. By making translation services available, Maria ensured that Latino and Cambodian parents participated fully in the workshop.</li>
<li>Maria was elected Chairwoman of the Lynn Shannon Grant Steering Committee, a state sponsored committee consisting of key community leaders working together to stop gang violence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strong Advocate for the Lynn Schools</h3>
<p>Maria has been working hard to bring in more money to the City of Lynn for our schools. </p>
<ul>
<li>She invited the US census to partner with the Lynn School Department to ensure that everyone in Lynn is counted which will bring in federal and state aid to our community.</li>
<li>As a member of the grants committee, she is pursuing stimulus money for the City of Lynn.</li>
<li>Maria took a leadership role in getting the School Committee to organize opposition to Question 1, which would have dismantled our school system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>More about Maria</h2>
<h3>Community involvement</h3>
<p>In October, 2012 Governor Deval Patrick named Maria to the Board of Trustees of North Shore Community College.</p>
<p>She has also volunteered with many other community organizations and non-profits, including Operation Bootstrap (Board of Directors), Gregg House, the New Lynn Coalition (President), the Shannon Grant Steering Committee in Lynn (Chair), the Lynn Hispanic Scholarship Fun (President), Neighbor to Neighbor, the Highlands Coalition, and Lynn United for Change.</p>
<h3>Background and philosophy</h3>
<p>"Lynn is a city that my family and I have been invested in for over a quarter of a century. I was born in the Dominican Republic and taught school there for 15 years but I wanted something more... I felt the urge to come to America to forge a better life.</p>
<p>"Lynn was the place where I wanted to settle and raise my family because of its tightly knit working class community. Lynn has been very good to my family; all my children have graduated from Lynn Public Schools and two of my grandchildren are currently in the school system.</p>
<p>"When I came to this country, I could not speak English well. I was forced to quit teaching and take up work at a shoe factory. I knew that the keys to my success, and my family’s success would be hard work, dedication and education. I enrolled in North Shore Community College where I honed my English skills, and received an Associate's Degree.</p>
<p>"My education afforded unique opportunities to me and for that I will always be grateful. As I had dedicated myself to learning, I decided that I would dedicate myself to the improvement of the community around me. I worked as a substance abuse counselor for eight years and for the past 19 years I have worked as a case manager at North Shore Career Center. I have also served on the Operation Bootstraps Board of Directors for the past two years and have been President of the Lynn Hispanic Scholarship Organization for the last four years...</p>
<p>"Through my work and volunteer activities I learned about the needs of local youth, who are faced with the dangers common in cities today even as they emerge from high school in need of job skills.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"We need policies that reach out and bring families back into the fold. Parents must have communication with teachers as well as those who are setting the policies which affect the learning experience of our youth. That is why, if elected, I would fight to strengthen communication with parents so that they, too, would have a voice in how their child is being educated."</p>
